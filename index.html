<h3>Getting Started with Your Hardware Wallet</h3>
<p>Thank you for choosing Ledger to secure your digital assets! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to set up your Ledger hardware wallet and ensure your cryptocurrencies are safe. Please follow these instructions carefully to get started.</p>
<h3>1. Unboxing Your Ledger Device</h3>
<p>When you receive your Ledger device, ensure the packaging is intact and hasn't been tampered with. Inside the box, you should find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Ledger hardware wallet (Nano S, Nano X, or Stax)</li>
<li>A USB cable for connecting to your computer</li>
<li>Recovery phrase sheet(s)</li>
<li>Instructions for setup</li>
<li>Optional accessories (keychain, lanyard, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Setting Up Your Ledger Device</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Connect Your Device</strong><br />Use the USB cable provided to connect your Ledger device to your computer. If you're using a Ledger Nano X, you can also set it up via Bluetooth on a mobile device.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Power On and Select Language</strong><br />Turn on your Ledger by pressing the button(s). Select your preferred language using the buttons on the device.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Install Ledger Live</strong><br />Ledger Live is the official desktop application for managing your Ledger hardware wallet. Download it from the official Ledger website: <a target="_new" rel="noopener">ledger.com/live</a>. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Initialize Your Device</strong><br />Choose the "Set up as new device" option if this is your first time using a Ledger. You'll then be prompted to create a PIN code. This PIN code will be required each time you connect your Ledger device. Make sure to choose a secure, memorable PIN.</p>
<h3>3. Writing Down Your Recovery Phrase</h3>
<p>After setting your PIN, your Ledger device will display a recovery phrase (usually 24 words). This phrase is crucial for restoring your wallet if your device is lost or damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Write Down the Recovery Phrase</strong><br />Use the recovery phrase sheet provided to write down each word in the correct order. This phrase is your backup and must be stored securely.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Confirm Your Recovery Phrase</strong><br />Your Ledger device will ask you to confirm your recovery phrase by selecting each word in the correct order. This step ensures you've written down the phrase correctly.</p>
<h3>4. Installing Apps on Your Ledger Device</h3>
<p>Ledger devices support various cryptocurrencies. To manage specific cryptocurrencies, you need to install corresponding apps on your device.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Ledger Live</strong><br />Open the Ledger Live app on your computer and navigate to the "Manager" section.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Connect and Allow Manager Access</strong><br />Connect your Ledger device to your computer. On your Ledger device, allow the Ledger Manager by confirming when prompted.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Install Cryptocurrency Apps</strong><br />Within the Ledger Live app, search for and install apps for the cryptocurrencies you plan to manage (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). Follow on-screen instructions to complete the installation.</p>
<h3>5. Adding Accounts to Ledger Live</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Ledger Live and Select "Accounts"</strong><br />Navigate to the "Accounts" tab within Ledger Live.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Your Accounts</strong><br />Click "Add Account," choose the cryptocurrency you installed earlier, and follow the prompts to add an account. Your Ledger device will verify and display account information.</p>
<h3>6. Making Transactions</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Ledger Live and Select an Account</strong><br />Choose the account you want to transact from within Ledger Live.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Send or Receive Cryptocurrency</strong><br />To receive cryptocurrency, click "Receive," and Ledger Live will display a receiving address. Use this address to receive funds.<br />To send cryptocurrency, click "Send," enter the recipient&rsquo;s address, specify the amount, and confirm the transaction on your Ledger device.</p>
<h3>7. Keeping Your Ledger Device Secure</h3>
<p>Your Ledger device is designed to be highly secure, but here are a few tips to keep it safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never share your recovery phrase with anyone.</li>
<li>Store your recovery phrase in a secure location, not digitally.</li>
<li>Always use the official Ledger Live app for transactions and management.</li>
<li>Regularly update your Ledger device firmware and Ledger Live app for the latest security features.</li>
</ul>
